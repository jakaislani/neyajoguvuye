Kanye West, you miserable motherf***** gimp-mask wearing motherf*****. You’re sitting there talking to a person who, god forbid, your kids were in that classroom in Sandy Hook, he denied that that happened. That’s where you’re at. And you’re bringing up the most despicable person ever and saying there’s good in him? In a gimp mask? You think that Adolf Hitler wouldn’t have thrown your ass in an oven or shot you in the street and not even thought twice about it you dumb f***? There’s no good in him. And at this point, I believe what was good in you is gone. And your mother, God rest her soul, would be ashamed of you and what you’ve become, you f***, you.”</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Among other reactions was <a href=#>Joe DiMaggio’s also-expletive driven anger directed at West</a>, as well as <a href=#>Mark Hamill offering a more subdued anti-Nazi response</a>. Twitter boss <a href=#>Elon Musk responded to one of West’s recent tweets</a> with some weird pacifist remark about turning the other cheek, whatever that is supposed to mean.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=false>According to the <a href=#>Anti-Defamation League</a>, antisemitic incidents reached an “all-time high” in 2021, and 2022 is on a similar track. This includes assault, harassment, and vandalism.
