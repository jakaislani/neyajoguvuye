It makes your ideal type of brownie (cakey or fudgy, we’ll take either), it’s easy to prep, and it’s on this list. We tasted ten different boxes of brownie mix in search of the best box brownie mix and ate tray after tray (we do this all for you, you’re welcome). The result? Five earned spots on our best boxed brownie mix. Read to find out more.&nbsp;</p><p>Few things are as intoxicating as freshly baked brownies, so learning that I would have to taste ten pans of freshly baked brownies was hardly a “woe is me” moment, especially knowing I’d get to make them from boxed brownie mixes.</p><p>I’m a competent baker, but I can relate my relationship to baking to a quote attributed to writer Dorothy Parker: “I hate writing, but I love having written.” I hate baking, but I love having baked. Baking is daunting. It’s messy. It’s time-consuming. With boxed brownie mixes, I don’t have to worry.&nbsp; Enough legwork is done that I can follow instructions without panic, but I still get to enjoy the process (“process” means licking the bowl).</p><p>If you’re a brownie fan whose preferred effort level is between “buy the finished thing” and “make it from scratch,” the best boxed brownie mixes are the heroes we need. So, I baked and tasted ten different brands of boxed brownie mixes in order to report back on the best brownie mix.&nbsp;</p><p>I made them all according to package directions. If given the option, I followed instructions for “fudgy brownies” rather than “cakey brownies.” I then tasted all of the baked brownies blind, which resulted in a lot of crumbs everywhere, a chocolate mustache, and a surprise first place winner that I am humbled and honored to crown the best boxed brownie mix.&nbsp;</p><p>One more thing, before I dive into the official ranking of the best brownie mixes. A quick honorable mention for Betty Crocker Reese’s Brownie Mix. While it’s objectively not the best brownies mix for everyone, it was one of my personal favorites because, for me, putting peanut butter in a product is like winning a race that everyone else is running while you’re flying in a private jet straight to the finish line. If you feel the same, you should definitely try it.&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, now let’s get down to business. Here are the best brownie mixes.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Duncan Hines Chewy Fudge Brownie Mix" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_brownie-mix_inset-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best for a Brownie Sundae</strong></p><strong>Duncan Hines Chewy Fudge Brownie Mix</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Despite following instructions for a chewy brownie, Duncan Hines’ brownie mix turned out some of the more cakey brownies of the bunch. It’s a basic, no-frills brownie—not so rich that it’s off-putting, but not so light that it won’t satisfy a serious chocolate craving. It’s not the best boxed brownie mix, but it’s a very good brownie mix—especially if you’re looking for a chocolatey base for a brownie sundae.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge Brownie Mix" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_brownie-mix_inset-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Cakey</strong></p><strong>Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge Brownie Mix</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>This was another mix that was on the cakey end of the spectrum, but even as someone that prefers a fudgy brownie, I enjoyed it. The crust is pleasantly chewy, and the brownie is lighter in both texture and chocolate flavor than its competitors. If you’re not in the market for a solid block of fudgy goodness, this is for you. Even if you are in the market for a solid block of fudgy goodness, this is more than enjoyable. And it’s definitely the best brownie mix brand if you love a cakey brownie.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Duncan Hines Dolly Parton's Fabulously Fudgy Brownie Mix" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_brownie-mix_inset-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Fudgy</strong></p><strong>Duncan Hines Dolly Parton’s Fabulously Fudgy Brownie Mix</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>It is 0% surprising that queen Dolly ranked so high. The woman can sing, act, philanthropize, and apparently make some of the best brownies mix. Out of all the brownie mixes we tried, it tasted the most homemade. And if you’re looking for fudgy, this is the best brownie mix for you. Even the fully cooked brownie was like chewing brownie batter.&nbsp;</p><p>And it doesn’t end there. This is also the best boxed brownie mix for those who love very precise cooking guidance. The mix includes a fudge pack and specific instructions to knead the fudge pack 15 times. I was skeptical at first, and frankly annoyed at the prospect of doing any amount of work, but when Dolly tells you to knead a fudge pack 15 times, you knead a fudge pack 15 times. As it turns out, it was both enjoyable and made for some dang good brownies. Is there anything Dolly can’t do?!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Brownie Mix" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_brownie-mix_inset-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Extra Chocolatey</strong></p><strong>Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Brownie Mix</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Everybody was so sure that this would be the best box brownie mix, which is why I made this a blind taste test. I needed to find out if it lived up to the hype without the brand name behind it. And now I can confidently confirm that it is, indeed, one of the best brownie mixes. The brownie has a great chew—it’s moist without being gummy, rich without being overwhelming, and it’s packed with chocolate chips but not overwhelmed by them. A friend, tasting companion, and brilliant wordsmith described the brownie and chip combination as “the boba of brownies,” which is high praise that’s very well-deserved.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="King Arthur Baking Company Gluten Free Ultimate Fudge Brownie Mix" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ranking_brownie-mix_inset-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>King Arthur Baking Company Gluten Free Ultimate Fudge</strong> <strong>Brownie Mix</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>King Arthur</a><p>Rocky. The Karate Kid. The Patriots in the 2017 Super Bowl. All of these underdog stories pale in comparison to King Arthur, who came out swinging with a gluten-free brownie mix that knocked Ghirardelli out of the top spot. These brownies are fudgy and chocolatey without sacrificing balance or being sweet for sweetness’s sake. They are melt-in-your-mouth without being gloopy or too heavy. It elicited a “WOW” as soon as I took a bite; the sound just escaped me before I even knew it was happening. This brownie transcended the control I have over my reactions, and is the ultimate mic-drop to anyone that doubts gluten-free can be delicious. A gluten-free brownie mix is the best brownie mix. If I could give it 11 sporks, I would.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / King Arthur</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other brownie mixes we tried: </strong>Krusteaz Gluten Free Double Chocolate Brownie Mix, Ghirardelli Ultimate Chocolate, Ghiradelli Caramel Walnut Truffle, Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free Brownie Mix, Betty Crocker Reese’s Brownie Mix</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFurtGorqehlWK6qsSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
