By the time she was 12, she had already started dancing, and at the age of 12, she had started singing. However, initially, she was shy to show her singing talent until she got positive feedbacks.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>And having loving parents by her side, the&nbsp;Easy&nbsp;hitmaker's family supported her artistic aspirations. To help her realize her show-biz&nbsp;dreams, her parents left their booming restaurant business in Orlando and moved to LA.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although she had already posted cover songs of Musiq Soulchild's 'So Beautiful' on YouTube, her career didn't officially start until she moved to LA.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>She then started as a background dancer for artists, including Pharrell Williams and Nelly Furtado.
