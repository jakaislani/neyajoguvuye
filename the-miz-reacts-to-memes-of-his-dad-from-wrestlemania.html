Sure, that ‘something’ may have been a comedic edge, but the two managed to pull it off pretty well in the build-up to the showcase of the immortals.</p><p>One might wonder how the son of George, aka The Miz, might react to all of the memes floating around from Mania: and now we have our answer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>The memes in question stem from the point of the match in which George got into the ring, and actively tried to include himself in the match. Some suggested that spot was put into the bout a bit too early on and removed some of the ‘drama’ from it, but to be honest, all people are going to remember is how fun the match itself was as a whole.</p><p>You’d think that WWE would move on from this whole feud and saga as a whole, but when it comes to things that get a lot of interest online, WWE tends to milk that cow until the very last drop.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see where The Miz goes from here now, because despite how well received his babyface turn has been, the loss at Mania may have hurt his long term chances of challenging for a world title again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49tZmpqX6m1pnnMorFmqpWWsLW%2FjK2mZqWVorK0ec6fZKGho2KxorCMn6mopV2sv6a%2F06Wcppmenq5w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
