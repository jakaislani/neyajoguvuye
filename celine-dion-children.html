The title translates as “It Was Only a Dream” or “Nothing But A Dream.”</p><p>Michel forwarded the recording to René Angélil, a music manager whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Dion’s voice moved Angélil to tears, and he decided to make her a star.</p><p>In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first album, La voix du bon Dieu, which became a local No. 1 hit and catapulted her to stardom in Quebec.</p><p>When she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, she won the musician’s award for “Top Performer” as well as the gold medal for “Best Song” with “Tellement j’ai d’amour pour toi.”</p><p>By 1983, Dion had won several Félix Awards, including “Best Female Performer” and “Discovery of the Year,” in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single “D’amour ou d’amitié.”</p><p>She had even more success when she represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song “Ne partez pas sans moi,” which she won by a narrow margin in Dublin.</p><p>After seeing a Michael Jackson performance when she was 18, Dion told Angélil she wanted to be a star like Jackson.</p><p>Despite her confidence in her abilities, Angélil recognized that her image needed to be altered in order for her to be marketed globally.</p><p>She stepped away from the spotlight for several months, during which she underwent cosmetic dental surgery and was sent to the École Berlitz in 1989 to improve her English.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Celine Dion Children: Who are Celine Dion’s Children?</h2><p>Celine Dion and her late husband had three children.
