When a male leopard appears and a courtship seems on the horizon, the jealous soldier uses mud to cover himself with spots, so he can seem to be a male leopard, too.</p><p>The actor worked with three trained leopards in filming these scenes, which win our admiration for their beauty and difficulty even as we're trying to puzzle them out on some plane above the "Wild Kingdom'' level. And the film is beautifully photographed. But the longer the courtship continues, the more it seems like a weird exercise in surrealism; I didn't believe it on a literal level and couldn't get it to work on any other.</p><p>Where did the writer-director, <a href=#>Lavinia Currier</a>, get the idea for this story? Not in a million years would I have guessed the answer: from Balzac. Yes, from Honore de Balzac, the 19th century French saint of social realism. The critic Michael Atkinson has pointed out that Balzac's story, however, is titled "A Passion in the Desert,'' and that little "A'' makes all the difference--suggesting the suffering of Christ rather than, as Atkinson puts it, "a soft-porn <a href=#>Bo Derek</a> film from the '80s.'' I am informed by a reader that the Vancouver, B.C., movie ratings board has, in addition to everything our own MPAA warns us about, a warning about "animal husbandry,'' in which animals engage in reproductive frolic. Mercifully, Augustin and the leopard hold the line at goo-goo eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46pmKyrmaS7brXNZquhnV2ZsrSx0a1kanFpbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
