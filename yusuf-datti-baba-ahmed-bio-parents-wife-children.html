He was born on July 7th, 1969, and hails from the prominent Baba-Ahmed family of Zaria.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed Biography</h2><p>Baba-Ahmed holds a degree from the University of Maiduguri and has a background in business and banking.</p><p>Baba-Ahmed first entered politics in 2003, when he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives for Zaria. During his time in office, he gained a reputation for being a vocal critic of corruption and the Third Term Agenda. He was known for advocating for good governance and speaking out against unethical practices in government.</p><p>After leaving office in 2007, Baba-Ahmed returned to his business ventures and founded Baze University. However, he remained active in the political sphere and returned to politics in 2011 when he ran for Senator for Kaduna North. Despite winning the election, his victory was overturned by an electoral tribunal and he left office in 2012.</p><p>In 2019, Baba-Ahmed made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in the PDP primary. However, he did not give up on his political aspirations and in 2022, he joined the Labour Party. In the 2023 presidential election, Baba-Ahmed has been selected as Peter Obi’s running mate and is the party’s vice presidential nominee.</p><p>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed was first elected as a Federal House of Representative member for the Zaria Federal Constituency in April 2003. He ran for office under the All Nigeria People’s Party (ANPP) platform and was known for his principled activism. During the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo, Baba-Ahmed was among the lawmakers who opposed the proposal to let Obasanjo run for a third term. In 2006, he announced that he would not run for re-election unless an investigation was carried out into allegations that members of the house had been bribed to support the constitutional changes needed for a third term presidency. In 2007, he took the Independent National Electoral Commission to court over their conduct in past elections.</p><p>In 2011, Baba-Ahmed won the Kaduna North Senatorial elections under the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) but the victory was later challenged in court by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate and was overturned. In 2018, he ran unsuccessfully for the Presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In 2022, he dropped out as a gubernatorial aspirant in the PDP primaries for the 2023 governorship elections in Kaduna State due to his refusal to buy delegate votes. On July 8th, 2022, he was nominated as the Vice Presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 Nigeria General Election.</p><p>Baba-Ahmed is a strong advocate for transparency and accountability. He spoke at an Islamic media forum in Abuja in 2008 and called on journalists to fearlessly submit accurate reports, acknowledging that corruption in the country was widespread and that all stakeholders needed to work together to address it. He is also the founder and Pro-Chancellor of Baze University in Abuja, which opened in April 2011. He was motivated to start the university due to his disappointment with the quality of education in Nigeria, which he described as “appalling”. Baba-Ahmed is also the Managing Director of Baze Research and Data Services Ltd.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed Age</h2><p>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed was born on July 7, 1969, making him 53 years old as of 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed Parents</h2><p>His father is known as Baba Ahmed, however, the name of his mother is not known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed Wife</h2><p>His wife is known as Hajiya Datti.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed Children</h2><p>We gathered that he is a father, however, their details are not known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed Net Worth</h2><p>We gathered that he has an estimated net worth of $83.2 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrKsrK2WYrGiwNOiZJuZkpZ6orTMnptmmpmkerGt0Z6lratdrLansYycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
