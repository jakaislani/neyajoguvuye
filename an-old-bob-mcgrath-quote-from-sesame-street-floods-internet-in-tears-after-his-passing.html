Sesame Street took this as an opportunity to teach children about death and how difficult it can be to come to terms with it. In the clip, Big Bird struggles to accept that his friend is truly gone and talks about how it won‚Äôt be the same without him. At this point, McGrath, playing the character of Bob Johnson, steps in to offer these words of comfort and wisdom,</p><p>You‚Äôre right, Big Bird. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll never be the same around here without him. But you know something?
