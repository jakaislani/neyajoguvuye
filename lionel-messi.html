He was born on 24th June 1987 in Rosario, Argentina to Jorge Lorenzo Márquez Pedrosa. Lionel plays for Argentina national team and Barcelona as a forward. He also own Spanish nationality, meaning he can also play for Spanish football team. He is massively recognized by many critics and experts as the leading football player of the era. Lionel Messi has five Ballon d’Or awards and also awarded with FIFA World Player of the year 2009.</p><p>Lionel Messi started football at a very young age and his talent was rapidly observed by Barcelona. He left Old Newell’s Boys’ youth team in the year 2000 and settled with his family in Europe to play for Barcelona. They afterward moved towards Spain as Barcelona provided treatment for his growth hormonal insufficiency.</p><p>Lionel Messi started in 2004–2005 season, and scored his very first goal on 1st May 2005 counter to Albacete from a contribution by Ronaldinho. Lionel first good season was in 2006–2007 season; he finally turned into a first team regular, by way of three consecutive scores in El Clásico. Lionel Messi scored 14 goals in 26 games. Messi’s most prosperous season was 2008–2009. Wherein, he scored 38 goals. In 2009–2010, he scored 47 goals in all league games.</p><p>In 2005, Lionel Messi decided to play for his native country, Argentina. He headed the team in final game of 2005 U-20 World Cup counter to Nigeria, which ended in 2–1 Argentine success.

In shootout, Lionel Messi missed his penalty. That was Messi’s 3rd consecutive defeat in an important final tournament with Argentina. A day after his match, Messi declared his retirement from international football.</p><h3>Why Messi Never Won a World Cup?</h3><p>Lionel Messi has not won a World Cup with the Argentina national team. There are a few reasons for this.</p><p>First, Argentina has not had a particularly strong team in recent World Cups. While the team has made it to the final on three occasions (1978, 1986, and 2014), they have not been able to win the tournament. In addition, Argentina has not always performed well in World Cup qualifying, and they have missed out on the tournament a few times in recent decades.</p><p>Second, Argentina has often had to rely heavily on Messi to produce goals and create scoring opportunities. While Messi has consistently performed at a high level for his club team, Barcelona, he has not always been able to replicate that level of performance for the national team.</p><p>But in the World Cup of 2022 held in Qatar, Messi won World Cup for his country Argentina.</p><h4>Notable Records Held by Messi</h4><li><strong>Most goals in a calendar year</strong>: In 2012, Messi scored 91 goals in 69 games, breaking the previous record of 85 goals set by Gerd Muller in 1972.</li><li><strong>Most goals scored in a single season in Europe’s top five leagues:</strong> In the 2011-2012 season, Messi scored 73 goals in all competitions for Barcelona, breaking the previous record of 67 goals set by <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a> in the 2013-2014 season.</li><li><strong>Most goals scored in a single Champions League season</strong>: In the 2011-2012 season, Messi scored 14 goals in the Champions League, breaking the previous record of 12 goals set by Ruud van Nistelrooy in the 2002-2003 season.</li><li><strong>Most goals scored in a single La Liga season</strong>: In the 2011-2012 season, Messi scored 50 goals in La Liga, breaking the previous record of 38 goals set by Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2010-2011 season.</li><li><strong>Most Ballon d’Or awards</strong>: Messi has won the Ballon d’Or award a record six times, which is given annually to the best male soccer player in the world.
