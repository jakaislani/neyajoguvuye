A grand farewell before leaving public life for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">21 months</a>. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Haegeum”</a> musician’s conscription will be three months longer than his peers’ since, due to a past shoulder injury, SUGA decided to enlist in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social service work</a> instead of active duty.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Although the artist live-streamed his Japan and South Korea concerts for ARMYs around the world, even providing showings in cinemas, this upcoming movie is professionally filmed, edited, and produced.

The Japan showings will happen on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">April 24</a>. The concert film will capture the rapper’s final concerts at the KSPO Dome in Seoul, South Korea — three encore dates under the banner SUGA | Agust D TOUR ‘D-DAY’ THE FINAL, which featured special performances by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fellow BTS members</a> Jungkook, Jimin, and RM. SUGA left each of his bandmates on stage to perform their solo work, after they joined him to sing the Agust D tracks “Burn It,” fan-favorite “Tony Montana,” and the first-ever live performance of “Strange.”</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>The D-Day Tour was defined by the intimacy of SUGA’s performance as he made his way through his three Agust D albums, Agust D, D-2, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">D-Day</a>, and his solo music within BTS in both high-production and acoustic sets. The stage was slowly picked apart as the concert progressed, leaving the artist on the venue floor by the last song, aptly titled “The Last,” a powerful angry anthem about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoongi’s hardships before becoming a K-Pop idol</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When will the tickets for D-Day The Movie go on sale?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SUGA-Agust-D-D-DAY-Tour-Movie.jpg><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Tickets for the D-Day The Movie concert film go on sale March 12, at 8 am PT/11 am ET/3 pm GMT/10 pm ICT for both regular and premium formats like IMAX.
