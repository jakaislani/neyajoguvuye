I responded with a very clear, ‘Please do not come.’ They came anyway. … I personally went up to Ms. Swift, whose entrance distracted the entire event, politely introduced myself to her, and asked her as nicely as I could to leave. It was like talking to a ghost. She seemed to look right past me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>On August 23 on Today, Kathie Lee confirmed Vicki’s story, saying that Conor Kennedy had not RSVP’d to Vicki’s daughter’s wedding. He asked Vicki if he could bring his girlfriend — Taylor. Vicki politely said no but then he came with her anyway. Vicki reportedly asked Taylor to leave the event twice.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kathie Lee saw Conor take Taylor’s hand and leave but Kathie Lee didn’t realize the drama that was going on until she saw it in the papers the next day.</p><h3>Taylor Speaks Out On Wedding Crashing Incident</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Taylor responds in the October 22 issue of Rolling Stone, saying:</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I have no idea what happened there. I think that story was based on the biggest misunderstanding, ’cause I would never knowingly show up somewhere that I thought I wasn’t invited to. And I would never want to upstage anybody.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Taylor admits that she doesn’t read stories about her and banned Googling herself after a flat performance at the 2010 Grammy Awards.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I don’t think anyone is ever truly viewed as only one thing, as only good, as only well-behaved, as only respectful. In the beginning, when there would be a tiny news story about something that wasn’t true, I thought that meant my fans weren’t gonna show up to my next concert. But now, knock on wood…I feel like my fans have my back and I have theirs.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Are you glad Taylor addressed this scandal, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>More Taylor Swift News:</strong></p><li><a href=#>Taylor Swift: In Love With Conor Kennedy & Patrick Schwarzenegger? — Report</a></li><li>Taylor Swift Releases Vengeful New Song — Who Is It About?</li><li>Taylor Swift Reveals Title Song ‘Red’ — Admits She’s Not Over Her Ex</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWliZH5xe5BpZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2ssqWwyKeeZpuilsCpsdFmmquZo52ytHnKnqWnnZSueqq6056pr6GVrHqutdKupZ2doqjBorrDoqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
