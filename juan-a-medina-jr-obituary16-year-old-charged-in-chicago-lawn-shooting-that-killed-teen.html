Medina Jr Obituary,Death –&nbsp; </strong>In a devastating turn of events on Tuesday afternoon, Chicago’s Southwest Side became the scene of a double homicide as a 14-year-old boy and a 65-year-old man lost their lives. Chicago Police Department (CPD) reported that a 16-year-old boy, whose identity remains confidential due to his status as a minor, has been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the incident. The arrest took place on Friday in the 6700-block of South Artesian Avenue after the teen was identified as the suspect responsible for the fatal shooting of the man and boy, according to Chicago police.</p><p>The tragic event unfolded in the Chicago Lawn neighborhood at approximately 4:20 p.m. on Tuesday. The victims, identified as 14-year-old Juan A. Medina Jr. and 65-year-old Mario Medina by the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office, were standing in the 3500-block of West 61st Place when a gray vehicle approached. Without warning, two male suspects inside the vehicle opened fire, fatally injuring both victims. The 65-year-old man was rushed to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in critical condition but succumbed to his injuries shortly thereafter. The 14-year-old, tragically, was pronounced dead at the scene. Both victims resided in the same block where the incident occurred.</p><p>The suspects fled the scene, driving west on 61st Place, leaving a community in shock and mourning the loss of two lives cut short by senseless violence. Crisis responder and victim advocate Andrew Holmes shed some light on the situation, suggesting that an altercation may have preceded the shooting. “There was some type of altercation here. Some individual came to visit another individual; a gray car pulled up; they discharged that weapon, striking the 14-year-old,” Holmes said. “We don’t know if he knew the individuals or what was the relationship between the people that were coming to visit him, just don’t know.”</p><p>As the community grapples with this tragic incident, the legal process unfolds, seeking justice for the victims and their grieving families. The profound impact of such violence on a tight-knit neighborhood resonates, leaving questions and a palpable sense of sorrow in its wake.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwttSapWaZXaKypbXNmmSjql2kr6rA1JqpsmlmYsamrdFmpqWcXZi1or7GnptmoZ5isKm1wpqeqGWclsSvedKhpqismaO0bsDHmqtmo5mhuaawjK2cnqZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
