She came to prominence as a professional dancer in the reality TV show Dancing with the Stars, where she became a two-time professional champion. She then ventured into acting, making her feature film debut with 2010’s Burlesque. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-901 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Her first lead role was in the 2011 remake of Footloose. She continued to have main roles in such films as Rock of Ages (2012), Safe Haven (2013) and Paradise (2013). As a singer, she released her self-titled debut album on May 20, 2008.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><h2>Has Julianne Hough had Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>Some people think that the actress-singer-dancer has undergone plastic surgery to look attractive as she is now. One persistent rumor is that Hough has undergone breast implants as her bust size is believed to have doubled. Observers think that while her alleged new breasts don’t really look like they’re fake, it’s still strange that Hough would have that cup size increase all of sudden when she didn’t even gain weight recently. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her body is still the same, except for her chest, making some people conclude that the Safe Haven star has gone under the knife for a breast augmentation. Another rumor is that of a nose job. Some people say that her nose has gotten smaller from what it used to be. If Hough really had breast implants and a nose job, the results look flawless and natural as well.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsurgeries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Julianne-Hough-1.jpg alt="Julianne Hough " width=210 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsurgeries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Julianne-Hough-2.jpg alt="Julianne Hough " width=210 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3 class=related_post_title>Related Posts</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZpydnJqvtMHRoJyroZWoe6S7zGihrqSZlruvsYyhpq6fmGK9ra3SraCcZaOqv6ix0bJkm52WpL%2BmecCfq56qXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
