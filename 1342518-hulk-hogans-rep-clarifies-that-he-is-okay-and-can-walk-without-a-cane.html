Following the appearance, Kurt Angle claimed on his podcast <a href=#>The Kurt Angle Show</a> that Hogan had another back surgery and couldn’t feel his legs following the operation.</p><p>Angle said, “Hogan had his back surgery again. He had the nerves cut from his lower body. He can’t feel his lower body. He uses his cane to walk around. I thought he was using the cane because he had pain in his back. He doesn’t have any pain. He has nothing at all. He can’t feel anything. So now he can’t feel his legs. So he has to walk with a cane which is, you know, that’s pretty serious, man.”</p><p>In an update, those comments appear to be exaggerated. A representative for the Hulkster recently told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> that Hogan is okay. “(Hulk is) doing well and is not paralyzed. Everything is OK with him. Hulk is someone with a lot of humor,” the rep said before confirming the 69-year-old can walk without a cane.</p><p>H/T to <a href=#>Fightful</a> for the transcription.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJtaW5paGK1trjKZp%2Bon5GjwG6%2BxKlknKSRp7antcSsZK2gkal6qbGMoqpmp5uWxm6tzZ1knJmeYsSiuMpmrqKsmKTCtXnAZpqappU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
