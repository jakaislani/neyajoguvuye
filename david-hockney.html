There, he painted his famous swimming pool paintings. In the 1970s, Hockney began working in photography, creating photo collages he called joiners. He continues to create and exhibit art, and in 2011, he was voted the most influential British artist of the 20th century.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hockney was born in Bradford, England, on July 9, 1937. He loved books and was interested in art from an early age, admiring <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/pablo-picasso data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Picasso class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Picasso</a>, Matisse and Fragonard. His parents encouraged their son’s artistic exploration, and gave him the freedom to doodle and daydream.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hockney attended the Bradford College of Art from 1953 to 1957. Then, because he was a conscientious objector to military service, he spent two years working in hospitals to fulfill his national service requirement. In 1959, he entered graduate school at the Royal College of Art in London alongside other young artists such as Peter Blake and Allen Jones. He experimented with different forms, including abstract expressionism. He did well as a student, and his paintings won prizes and were purchased for private collections.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Work & Photography</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hockney’s early paintings incorporated his literary leanings, and he used fragments of poems and quotations from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/walt-whitman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walt Whitman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Walt Whitman</a> in his work. This practice, and paintings such as We Two Boys Clinging Together, which he created in 1961, were the first nods to his homosexuality in his art.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Because he frequently went to the movies with his father as a child, Hockney once quipped that he was raised in both Bradford and Hollywood. He was drawn to the light and the heat of California, and first visited Los Angeles in 1963. He officially moved there in 1966. The swimming pools of L.A. were one of his favorite subjects, and he became known for large, iconic works such as A Bigger Splash. His expressionistic style evolved, and by the 1970s, he was considered more of a realist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to pools, Hockney painted the interiors and exteriors of California homes. In 1970, this led to the creation of his first “joiner,” an assemblage of Polaroid photos laid out in a grid. Although this medium would become one of his claims to fame, he stumbled upon it by accident. While working on a painting of a Los Angeles living room, he took a series of photos for his own reference, and fixed them together so he could paint from the image. When he finished, however, he recognized the collage as an art form unto itself, and began to create more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hockney was an adept photographer, and he began working with photography more extensively. By the mid 1970s, he had all but abandoned painting in favor of projects involving photography, lithographs, and set and costume design for the ballet, opera and theater.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Work</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the late 1980s, Hockney returned to painting, primarily painting seascapes, flowers and portraits of loved ones. He also began incorporating technology in his art, creating his first homemade prints on a photocopier in 1986. The marriage of art and technology became an ongoing fascination—he used laser fax machines and laser printers in 1990, and in 2009, he started using the Brushes app on iPhones and iPads to create paintings. A 2011 exhibit at the Royal Museum of Ontario showcased 100 of these paintings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In a 2011 poll of more than 1,000 British artists, Hockney was voted the most influential British artist of all time. He continues to paint and exhibit, and advocates for funding for the arts.</p><ul data-node-id=17 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: David Hockney</li><li>Birth Year: 1937</li><li>Birth date: July 9, 1937</li><li>Birth City: Bradford</li><li>Birth Country: England</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Known for his photo collages and paintings of Los Angeles swimming pools, David Hockney is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th century.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Opera</li><li>Art</li><li>Education and Academia</li><li>Theater and Dance</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Royal College of Art, London</li><li>Bradford College of Art</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=20><ul data-node-id=22 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: David Hockney Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/artists/david-hockney</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: October 26, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYq6yZqMG0e8OaraKcXZ28pLfNnrA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
