More, Eisley portrayed Ashley Juergens in the television series “The Secret Life of the American Teenager”. India has been active in the entertainment industry since 2003.</p><p>How much is the net worth of India Eisley? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of her wealth is as much as $2 million, as of the data presented in early 2018. Film and television are the main sources of Eisley’s modest fortune.</p><h3>India Eisley (Actress) Net Worth $2 million</h3><p>To begin with, the girl was raised in Los Angeles, the daughter of Olivia Hussey, an actress particularly known for playing the role of Juliet in “Romeo and Juliet” by Franco Zeffirelli, and musician and actor David Glen Eisley. There is no information about her childhood or education.</p><p>Concerning her professional career, India debuted playing uncredited role of English Girl in the film “Mother Teresa of Calcutta” (2003), followed by a small role in the horror film “Headspace” (2005) directed by Andrew van den Houten. However, from 2008 to 2013 Eisley had a main role in the award winning teen drama series “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” aired on ABC Family, which certainly established her net worth.</p><p>Meantime in 2012, the actress starred alongside <a href=#>Theo James</a> and <a href=#>Michael Ealy</a> in the action horror film “Underworld: Awakening” directed by Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein – even though critics’ reviews were mostly negative, the film grossed $160.1 million at the box office with a budget of $70 million. Afterwards, India landed the lead role of Sawa in the South African action film “Kite” (2014) by Ralph Ziman, and the same year was seen in the television film “Nanny Cam”. In 2015, Eisley was one of the main stars in the British romantic drama “Social Suicide”, which was inspired by Shakespeare’s tragedy “Romeo and Juliet”, and in which India’s mother Olivia Hussey, portrayed her on screen mother Mrs. Coulson. Then Eisley starred in the fantasy horror film “The Curse of Sleeping Beauty” (2016) by Pearry Reginald Teo, interpreting The Sleeping Beauty – Briar Rose. In addition, the actress portrayed the lead character Penny in the action film “Amerigeddon” (2016), which tells the story of a fictional attack on the US government. In 2016, the main role of Audrina Adare for the television film “My Sweet Audrina” was created by India, too, followed in 2017 by two feature films starring India Eisley – “Clinical” in which she interpreted Nora Green, and “Adolescence” in which she portrayed Alice. The film “Look Away” will be released late in 2018, in which India has the role of Maria.</p><p>To conclude, all the above mentioned roles have added sums to the size of India Eisley’s net worth.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the actress, India is probably still single, as there aren’t even any rumours of romantic associations. India does not reveal much about her private life.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.257261410788><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>India Eisley</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 29, 1993</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.6 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Olivia Hussey, David Glen Eisley</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Alexander Martin, Maximillian Fuse</td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/indiaeisley1029</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2086223/</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Movies</td><td>Amerigeddon, The Curse of Sleeping Beauty, Social Suicide, Sitter Cam, Kite, Underworld: Awakening, Headspace</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Secret Life of the American Teenager</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>[The interviewer asked India draw a lot from the anime or come up with her own take for her character for Kite.]: Not so much to draw from the anime because our version from the anime is kind of different, but I think it's pretty straight forward, she's falling apart emotionally and there's the other side of her that's a killing machine.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>The only time I was the cool kid at school was when my dad took me to school on his bike.
