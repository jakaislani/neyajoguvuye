Omarion is perhaps best known as a member of a music group called “B2K”, which consisted of Lil’ Fizz, J-Boog, Omarion and Raz-B. The group was active from 1998 until 2004, and during this time managed to release 7 studio albums and make an appearance in Chris Stokes’ film entitled “You Got Served” with Meagan Good, Marques Houston and Robert Hoffman. “B2K” first topped the charts in 2001 with the release of a single “Uh Huh”. “Uh Huh” was a mixture of dance beats and unique delivery, which set them apart from other boy bands. Shortly afterwards, the group released their debut album under the name of “B2K”, which landed on a #2 spot on the Billboard 200 chart and sold over 109 000 copies during its debut week. Following the success of their debut album, the band came out with “Pandemonium!”, which featured the group’s most popular single “Bump, Bump, Bump”. Around the same time, “B2K” went on a tour with Bow Wow, Nick Cannon, Mario and other artist, and made an appearance on television screens. However, in 2004, due to many internal conflicts, the group split up and Omarion went on to launch his solo career. In 2005, he released his debut solo album called “O”, which was later certified Gold by the RIAA and was even nominated for a Grammy Award. A famous singer and dancer, how rich is Omarion? According to sources, Omarion’s net worth is estimated to be $8 million. Undoubtedly, most of Omarion’s net worth and wealth came from his involvement in the music industry.</p><h3>Omarion Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>Born in 1984, in Inglewood, California, Omarion started his music career with “B2K” band. In 1999, Omarion received an offer from Chris Stokes to join a newly found band. Upon becoming a lead singer of the band, Omarion started making various public appearances with the group, until they eventually made a name for themselves. When group split up in 2004, Omarion went on to launch a solo career with his debut album called “O”. Since the album proved to be largely successful, Omarion was inspired to release his second studio work under the name of “21” shortly after. The album once again topped the music charts and received a Gold certification from the RIAA. So far, Omarion has released four studio albums, the most recent one being “Sex Playlist”, as well as three collaboration albums, one with Bow Wow and two with the “Maybach Music Group”. In addition to singing, Omarion is also a well-known actor, who has starred in such films and television series as “Fat Albert”, where he played the main role, “The Proud Family Movie” with Kyla Pratt, Tara Strong and Orlando Bloom, “Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami” with Kourtney and Khloe Kardashians, and “Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood” to name a few.
