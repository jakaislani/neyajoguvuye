She attended Oberlin College. Terrell was a suffragist and the first president of the National Association of Colored Women and — at the suggestion of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/web-du-bois data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="W.E.B. Du Bois" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">W.E.B. Du Bois</a> — a charter member of the NAACP.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An influential educator and activist, Mary Church Terrell was born Mary Eliza Church on September 23, 1863, in Memphis, Tennessee. Her parents, Robert Reed Church and his wife, Louisa Ayers, were both former enslaved people who used their freedom to become small-business owners and make themselves vital members of Memphis' growing Black population.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From an early age Terrell and her brother were taught the value of a good education. Hardworking and ambitious, Terrell went on to attend Oberlin College in Ohio, where, in 1884, she became one of the first African American women to earn a college degree. Four years later she earned her master's degree in education.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time she met Robert Heberton Terrell, a talented attorney who would eventually become Washington, D.C.'s first Black municipal judge. The couple married in 1891.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">An Activist's Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Terrell was not someone who sat on the sidelines. In her new life in Washington, D.C., where she and Robert settled after they married, she became especially involved in the women's rights movement. In particular, she focused much of her attention on securing the right to vote. But within the movement she found reluctance to include African American women, if not outright exclusion of them from the cause.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Terrell worked to change that. She spoke out frequently about the issue and with some fellow activists founded the National Association of Colored Women in 1896. She was immediately named the organization's first president, a position she used to advance social and educational reforms.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Other distinctions also came her way. Pushed by W.E.B. Du Bois, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People made Terrell a charter member. Later, she became the first African American woman ever appointed to a school board and then served on a committee that investigated alleged police mistreatment of African Americans.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In her late years, Terrell's commitment to taking on Jim Crow laws and pioneering new ground didn't wane. In 1949 she became the first African American admitted to the Washington chapter of the American Association of University Women. And it was Terrell who helped bring down segregated restaurants in her adopted home of Washington, D.C. After being refused service by a whites-only restaurant in 1950, Terrell and several other activists sued the establishment, laying the groundwork for the eventual court order that ruled that all segregated restaurants in the city were unconstitutional.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Toward the end of a life that witnessed fantastic civil-rights changes, Terrell saw the U.S. Supreme Court's historic Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954, which ended segregation in schools. Just two months later, Terrell died on July 24 in Annapolis, Maryland.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Today, Mary Church Terrell's home in Washington, D.C., has been named a National Historic Landmark.</p><ul data-node-id=19 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Terrell Church</li><li>Birth Year: 1863</li><li>Birth date: September 23, 1863</li><li>Birth State: Tennessee</li><li>Birth City: Memphis</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Mary Church Terrell was a charter member of the NAACP and an early advocate for civil rights and the suffrage movement.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Education and Academia</li><li>Civil Rights</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Libra</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Oberlin College</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1954</li><li>Death date: July 24, 1954</li><li>Death State: Maryland</li><li>Death City: Annapolis</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=22><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Mary Church Terrell Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/activists/mary-church-terrell</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: July 9, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=27 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I cannot help wondering sometimes what I might have become and might have done if I had lived in a country which had not circumscribed and handicapped me on account of my race, but had allowed me to reach any height I was able to attain.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJopJqqqWKwqcHRnJ9mrJWnv6a4yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
