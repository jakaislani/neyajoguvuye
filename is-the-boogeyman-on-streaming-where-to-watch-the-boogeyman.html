And if that feeling wasn’t already felt enough in our childhoods, then Rob Savage’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boogeyman</a></strong> is doing an excellent job at taking moviegoers for a stroll down memory lane. The fresh-faced cinematic horror, which is based on the iconic short story from author Stephen King, is successfully terrifying audiences with its prolific jump scares and eerie narrative.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>As a result, the film’s Rotten Tomatoes score remains encouraging, with no-nonsense critics around the internet expressing their satisfaction with the latest project. And while a vast multitude of horror die-hards surely have plenty of questions that need to be answered — some of which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can be viewed right here</a> — one of the biggest questions revolving around the horror movie is when exactly it will be released onto streaming platforms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-the-boogeyman-on-streaming data-injectable=false>Is The Boogeyman on streaming?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-boogeyman.jpg><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>As of right now, The Boogeyman is not available to watch on any streaming platform. Interestingly enough, before Stephen King himself stepped in and passed on a word of advice to release the movie in theaters, the project was initially going to be released on streaming service Hulu. But with how well the movie performed with test audiences and King bluntly sharing that the film being released <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on streaming would be stupid</a>, the decision was made for it to be released in theaters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-can-i-watch-the-boogeyman data-injectable=false>Where can I watch The Boogeyman?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-boogeyman.jpg><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=false>As previously mentioned, The Boogeyman was released in theaters this past weekend, making that the only way horror stans and film buffs can watch the movie right now. Of course, with this age of media, it’s surely only a matter of time (and months) before the horror spectacle will be available on streaming. It’s not yet confirmed if Hulu will be its landing spot, so horror fanatics should keep their eyes peeled in the coming months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlpJ2ybq7OqJ6esZ2Wu267zWaqraqVlrqqusZmrqGdopp6tbuMsJitm5hiwamxjJumqJ%2BVrrqiuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
