After the 64-year-old pop superstar was reported to be getting cozy with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andrew Darnell</strong></a>, a 23-year-old model, <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> can confirm they are “casually dating” thanks to an EXCLUSIVE source. “Madonna is casually dating Andrew Darnell and although some of her friends think the fact that he is 23 is a bit strange, Madonna does not seem to care at all,” the insider divulged. “She has never really let age affect her decision on who to date and who not to date and it is not like Madonna is going to settle down, nor does she want to.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>They added that while Madonna isn’t looking to get super serious with someone right now, Andrew is giving her exactly what she needs. “She is living her best life right now and is having fun. Andrew gives her the kind of passion that she wants in her life right now and after her recent split, she just wants to have fun,” the source explained. “It isn’t harming anyone, and Andrew is all about her. The two of them cannot keep their hands off each other when they are together, but this does not mean marriage to Madonna. She is done with all of that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The “Like a Virgin” hitmaker and 28-year-old<strong> Ahlamalik Williams</strong>, her former backup dancer, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ended their three-year relationship</a> in April.
