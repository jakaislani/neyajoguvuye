Our friends over at Rice Krispies Treats just Snap, Crackle, and Popped off. We’re all familiar with the textural symphony that is biting into a regular Rice Krispies Treat. And while some would say that the flavor of said treats is a bit one note, what a delicious note it is. Still, there are certainly people who love that signature Rice Krispies Treat texture but wish the flavor had a bit more “oomph.” Well, those people are in luck, because last week Kellanova (the snacky arm of cereal giant Kellogg’s) announced that it has a new snack coming down the pike. One that, according to a senior brand manager over at Kellanova, people all over the country have been writing to them to request for years. The snack in question? Chocolatey Peanut Butter Rice Krispies Treats. Yes, you read that right.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When and how can I get my hands on these peanut butter Rice Krispies Treats? Can I please have Snap, Crackle, and Pop’s addresses so I can send them each a personalized thank you note? (I’m not a cereal killer, I swear.)</h2><p>Before we get into how to acquire these things, let’s talk about what they’re supposed to taste like. According to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, these will be like the Rice Krispies Treats you know and love in terms of texture, except that these Chocolatey Peanut Butter Rice Krispies Treats will also be “the perfect blend of salty and sweet, with real peanut butter in every bite and a bonus layer of chocolatey goodness coating the bottom.” The packaging denotes the chocolatey PB-ness of it all by being half blue (like the regular ones) and half red (to signify the kind of alert going off in my brain right now telling me to buy these) with a delicious image of some peanut butter and chocolate.</p><p>As for when you can get your hands on these, you shouldn’t have to wait too long. They are slated to hit stores “in spring,” which (if you have been following along) it totally is already, so we could start seeing them on shelves any day now. And once they do hit, they will be going for $4.49 for a seven-pack or $8.42 for a 14-pack. I haven’t seen them in my area yet, but you can bet the minute I hear they have arrived, I will be Snap, Crackle, and Poppin’ over to the grocery store to try them out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKiVlru2wIybrK2slad6s7XCnmSkqpmovaqx0marq52RqcBuusSwqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
