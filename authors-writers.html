She wrote on her Facebook page that "Today I quit being a Christian. I'm out. I remain committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed. I'm an outsider. My conscience will allow nothing else."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Recently, Rice has delved into the world of werewolves with a new series, which began with The Wolf Gift (2012).
