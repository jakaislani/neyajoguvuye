The movie&nbsp;is an ad for The Blue Angels, the Navy, planes, the military generally, and an iconography-based sense of patriotism, as much as the "<a href=#>Top Gun</a>"&nbsp;films, the first of which was memorably described by New Yorker critic <a href=#>Pauline Kael</a> as "a recruiting poster that isn't concerned with recruiting but with being a poster."&nbsp;&nbsp;(The precision flying showcased in the "Top Gun"&nbsp;movies is inspired by The Blue Angels, and it just so happens that&nbsp;one of this film's producers is <a href=#>Glen Powell</a>, costar of "<a href=#>Top Gun: Maverick</a>.")&nbsp;</p><p>And the flying itself? And the filming of it?&nbsp;It's technically&nbsp;impressive. Not surprisingly framed, much less&nbsp;poetic (probably almost no one wanted that), but impressive.&nbsp;I saw The Blue Angels a couple of times as a kid and remember thinking that it seemed physically impossible for such large metal objects to fly so close to one another while roaring through the sky&nbsp;at hundreds of miles an hour. But they did it. They do it here, again, for the IMAX cameras, which seemingly were&nbsp;affixed to multiple parts of the planes' exteriors and cockpits. (How is it&nbsp;possible that we never see those cameras in the shots? Were they digitally erased later? Or are the cameras just that small, and the camera crew just&nbsp;that smart?)</p><p>Director <a href=#>Paul Crowder</a>, who also helped edit the movie, tries to find a narrative through-line by sketching out the members of the Blue Angels team. He focuses&nbsp;mainly (though not exclusively) on the Commanding Officer and Flight Leader, aka&nbsp;"<a href=#>Boss</a>," Captain Brian Kesselring, who eventually left the Angels and&nbsp;is now Deputy Commander, Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5. "My feeling is, you should never feel too comfortable in the suit,"&nbsp;he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Other members of the squadron drift in and out of the foreground. There's a bit of material about the strain placed on marriages and families by the pilots being on the road 300 days a year, but no talk of affairs, divorces, or anything like that (the Navy wouldn't have permitted it anyway).&nbsp;Towards the end of the movie, through a fluke of production timing, we also get to meet the Blue Angels' first-ever female pilot, <a href=#>Amanda Lee</a>, and watch her be&nbsp;inducted.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkqHCpnnAp56epKNisbCv1Kacp6yRp8ZussilpGaqlau2psOMa2drbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 HiveBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
